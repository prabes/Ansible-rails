## Getting Started
Here are the steps that you need to follow in order to get up and running with Ansible Rails.

### 1. Installation
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:codysseynepal/cap-ansible.git
    $ cd cap-ansible
    $ git checkout master

### 2. Configuration
Change `inventory.ini.sample` to `inventory.ini`

    $ mv inventory.ini.sample inventory.ini

Replace `<ip_address>` with target machine ip_address.

Replace `<your_ssh_user>` with the remote user by which SSH connection can be established

Replace `<your_deploy_user>` with the remote user you want to perform deploy with. `Make sure you give the same deploy user through-out the variable files.`

Open app-vars.yml and change the following variables. Additionally, please review the app-vars.yml and see if there is anything else that you would like to modify (e.g.: install some other packages, change ruby, node or postgresql versions etc.)
All the variables in `app-vars.yml` are described in [wiki here]()You can adjust them accordingly.

Here is list of required variables. Make sure that they are not empty and are correct.


      rails_app_name: APP_NAME (repo name)
      react_app_name: APP_NAME (repo name)

      # Users and Group
      deploy_user: REMOTE_DEPLOY_USER 

      # postgresql
      postgresql_version: "9.6"

      # Ruby
      rvm_rubies:
        - 'ruby-2.6.0'

      rvm_default_ruby_version: 'ruby-2.6.0' 
      rvm_bundler_version: '1.10.6' # bundler version 

      # Nodejs
      nodejs_version: "12.16.0" 

      # Deploy React
      deploy_branch_react: master

### Deploy

Before deploy, Check:

    $ ssh-add -l

If,    
 
    Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
Do:
 
    $ eval `ssh-agent`
    $ ssh-add

Now check,
    
    $ ssh-add -l

It should log something like:

    4096 SHA256:7whqRh1YTgyvfP2ViedHfero5t4/kj327j4g5kdfuj/ user@gmail.com (RSA)              â”‚

Now, We're ready to go.


To run the playbook:
    
    cap-ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory env_setup. 



### TODO's:
1. Add wiki:
  - Application Variables: Description and options 
      <!-- All the variables can be found in `app-vars.yml`.
      Here is the list, details and options that can be passed. -->
  - Architecture and control flow
  - SSH connections and users
2. Add specific README for all the roles
3. Task for maintaining releases
4. Task for bundle and deploy rails app 
5. Storing sensetive information 
  - Configure ansible-vault
6. Ansible Tower for automated playbook trigger


Please create issues if something problematic is found. Thank You!
